## Sprint 1
- [x] Choose a project topic
- [x] Create a GitHub account and join KSU-HMI in Github
- [x] Create code repository within the KHU-HMI organization
- [x] Edit and commit changes in the readme.md file in the respository
- [x] Explore at least one existing Python code base related to the project
- [x] https://github.com/YangChuan80/AusculPi-Console
- [x] https://github.com/Nyceane/Digital-Stethoscope-AI.git
- [x] Evaluate existing code and submit updates to the projectroadmap.md file explaining the findings
- [x] 
 Through my evalutation of the above code, both projects include high level code that currently at my skill level I will not be able to fully emulate. I have decided to begin with a very rudimentary version of the "Digital Stethoscope AI" audio recording code and begin from there. 
- [x] Attempt to run code with updates
## Sprint 2
- [x] Create audio recording code 
- [x] Determine which hardware will be used to create stethoscope
- [x] Build stethoscope
- [x] Create a heart detection function: Created a heartrate detection function. It is currently not working optimally. I might need to work on the hardware sensitivity as well as removing background noise.
- [x] Create a recording visualization: Created a Time-Domain signal plot.
- [x] Create a record button GUI
- [x] Make updates and add commit messages in the repository
- [x] Track progress on planned and emerging tasks in projectroadmap.md document.
## Sprint 3
- [ ] Improve audio quality/sensitivity
- [ ] Continue coding, refining, and testing
- [ ] Perform QA Testing
- [ ] Create Powerpoint introducing project
- [ ] Create tag line that introduces the main concept of what it does/will do
- [ ] Have two screenshots demonstrating the idea or parts
- [ ] Upload Powerpoint slide in D2L
- [ ] Have a copy in the Github repository
